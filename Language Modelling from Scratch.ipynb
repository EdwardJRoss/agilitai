      " Bob Dylan ( / <unk> / ; born Robert Allen Zimmerman , May 24 , 1941 ) is an American singer @-@ songwriter , artist and writer . He has been influential in popular music and culture for more than five decades . Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s when his songs chronicled social unrest , although Dylan repudiated suggestions from journalists that he was a spokesman for his generation . Nevertheless , early songs such as \" Blowin ' in the Wind \" and \" The Times They Are a @-@ <unk> ' \" became anthems for the American civil rights and anti @-@ war movements . After he left his initial base in the American folk music revival , his six @-@ minute single \" Like a Rolling Stone \" altered the range of popular music in 1965 . His mid @-@ 1960s recordings , backed by rock musicians , reached the top end of the United States music charts while also attracting <unk> and criticism from others in the folk movement . \n",
      " Dylan 's lyrics have incorporated various political , social , philosophical , and literary influences . They defied existing pop music conventions and appealed to the burgeoning counterculture . Initially inspired by the performances of Little Richard and the songwriting of Woody Guthrie , Robert Johnson , and Hank Williams , Dylan has amplified and <unk> musical genres . His recording career , spanning more than 50 years , has explored the traditions in American song — from folk , blues , and country to gospel , rock and roll , and rockabilly to English , Scottish , and Irish folk music , embracing even jazz and the Great American Songbook . Dylan performs with guitar , keyboards , and harmonica . Backed by a changing lineup of musicians , he has toured steadily since the late 1980s on what has been dubbed the Never Ending Tour . His accomplishments as a recording artist and performer have been central to his career , but songwriting is considered his greatest contribution . \n",
      " Since 1994 , Dylan has published six books of drawings and paintings , and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries . As a musician , Dylan has sold more than 100 million records , making him one of the best @-@ selling artists of all time . He has also received numerous awards including eleven Grammy Awards , a Golden Globe Award , and an Academy Award . Dylan has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , Minnesota Music Hall of Fame , Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame , and Songwriters Hall of Fame . The Pulitzer Prize jury in 2008 awarded him a special citation for \" his profound impact on popular music and American culture , marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power . \" In May 2012 , Dylan received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama . \n",

      " Bob Dylan was born Robert Allen Zimmerman ( Hebrew name <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> [ Shabtai <unk> ben <unk> ] ) in St Mary 's Hospital on May 24 , 1941 , in Duluth , Minnesota , and raised in Hibbing , Minnesota , on the <unk> Range west of Lake Superior . He has a younger brother , David . Dylan 's paternal grandparents , <unk> and Anna Zimmerman , emigrated from Odessa , in the Russian Empire ( now Ukraine ) , to the United States following the anti @-@ Semitic <unk> of 1905 . His maternal grandparents , Ben and Florence Stone , were Lithuanian Jews who arrived in the United States in 1902 . In his autobiography , Chronicles : Volume One , Dylan wrote that his paternal grandmother 's maiden name was <unk> and her family originated from <unk> district of <unk> Province in northeastern Turkey . \n",
      " Dylan 's parents , <unk> Zimmerman and <unk> \" Beatty \" Stone , were part of a small but close @-@ knit Jewish community . They lived in Duluth until Robert was six , when his father had <unk> and the family returned to his mother 's hometown , Hibbing , where they lived for the rest of Robert 's childhood . In his early years he listened to the radio — first to blues and country stations from Shreveport , Louisiana and later , when he was a teenager , to rock and roll . He formed several bands while attending Hibbing High School . In the Golden <unk> , he performed covers of songs by Little Richard and Elvis Presley . Their performance of Danny & the Juniors ' \" Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay \" at their high school talent show was so loud that the principal cut the microphone . In 1959 , his high school <unk> carried the caption \" Robert Zimmerman : to join ' Little Richard ' . \" The same year , as <unk> <unk> [ sic ] , he performed two dates with Bobby <unk> , playing piano and clapping . \n",
      " Zimmerman moved to Minneapolis in September 1959 and enrolled at the University of Minnesota . His focus on rock and roll gave way to American folk music . In 1985 , he said : \n",
      " The thing about rock 'n'roll is that for me anyway it wasn 't enough ... There were great catch @-@ phrases and driving pulse rhythms ... but the songs weren 't serious or didn 't reflect life in a realistic way . I knew that when I got into folk music , it was more of a serious type of thing . The songs are filled with more despair , more sadness , more triumph , more faith in the supernatural , much deeper feelings . \n",
      " He began to perform at the Ten O <unk> Scholar , a coffeehouse a few blocks from campus , and became involved in the <unk> folk music circuit . \n",
      " During his <unk> days , Zimmerman began introducing himself as \" Bob Dylan \" . In his memoir , Dylan acknowledged that he had been influenced by the poetry of Dylan Thomas . Explaining his change of name in a 2004 interview , Dylan remarked , \" You 're born , you know , the wrong names , wrong parents . I mean , that happens . You call yourself what you want to call yourself . This is the land of the free . \" \n",

      " In May 1960 , Dylan dropped out of college at the end of his first year . In January 1961 , he traveled to New York City , to perform there and visit his musical idol Woody Guthrie , who was seriously ill with Huntington 's disease in <unk> Park <unk> Hospital . Guthrie had been a revelation to Dylan and influenced his early performances . Describing Guthrie 's impact , he wrote : \" The songs themselves had the infinite sweep of humanity in them ... [ He ] was the true voice of the American spirit . I said to myself I was going to be Guthrie 's greatest disciple . \" As well as visiting Guthrie in hospital , Dylan befriended Guthrie 's <unk> Ramblin ' Jack Elliott . Much of Guthrie 's repertoire was channeled through Elliott , and Dylan paid tribute to Elliott in Chronicles : Volume One . \n",
      " From February 1961 , Dylan played at clubs around Greenwich Village . He befriended and picked up material from folk singers there , including Dave Van Ronk , Fred Neil , <unk> , the New Lost City <unk> , and Irish musicians the Clancy Brothers and Tommy <unk> . In September , Dylan gained public recognition when Robert Shelton wrote a review in The New York Times of a show at <unk> 's Folk City . The same month Dylan played harmonica on folk singer Carolyn <unk> 's third album , which brought his talents to the attention of the album 's producer , John Hammond . Hammond signed Dylan to Columbia Records in October . The performances on his first Columbia album — Bob Dylan — in March 1962 , consisted of familiar folk , blues and gospel with two original compositions . The album sold only 5 @,@ 000 in its first year , just enough to break even . Within Columbia Records , some referred to the singer as \" Hammond 's <unk> \" and suggested dropping his contract , but Hammond defended Dylan and was supported by Johnny Cash . In March 1962 , Dylan contributed harmonica and back @-@ up vocals to the album Three Kings and the Queen , accompanying Victoria Spivey and Big Joe Williams on a recording for Spivey Records . While working for Columbia , Dylan recorded under the pseudonym Blind Boy <unk> , for <unk> , a folk magazine and record label . Dylan used the pseudonym Bob <unk> to record as a piano player on The Blues Project , a 1964 anthology album by <unk> Records . As <unk> <unk> , Dylan played harmonica on Ramblin ' Jack Elliott 's 1964 album , Jack Elliott . \n",
      " Dylan made two important career moves in August 1962 : he legally changed his name to Robert Dylan , and he signed a management contract with Albert Grossman . ( In June 1961 , Dylan had signed an agreement with Roy Silver . In 1962 , Grossman paid Silver $ 10 @,@ 000 to become sole manager . ) Grossman remained Dylan 's manager until 1970 , and was notable for his sometimes <unk> personality and for protective loyalty . Dylan said , \" He was kind of like a Colonel Tom Parker figure ... you could smell him coming . \" Tensions between Grossman and John Hammond led to Hammond 's being replaced as producer of Dylan 's second album by the young African @-@ American jazz producer , Tom Wilson . \n",
      " Dylan made his first trip to the United Kingdom from December 1962 to January 1963 . He had been invited by TV director Philip Saville to appear in a drama , <unk> on Castle Street , which Saville was directing for BBC Television . At the end of the play , Dylan performed \" Blowin ' in the Wind \" , one of its first public performances . The film recording of <unk> on Castle Street was destroyed by the BBC in 1968 . While in London , Dylan performed at London folk clubs , including the <unk> , Les <unk> , and <unk> . He also learned material from UK performers , including Martin <unk> . \n",
      " By the time of Dylan 's second album , The Freewheelin ' Bob Dylan , in May 1963 , he had begun to make his name as a singer and a songwriter . Many songs on this album were labeled protest songs , inspired partly by Guthrie and influenced by Pete Seeger 's passion for topical songs . \" Oxford Town \" , for example , was an account of James Meredith 's ordeal as the first black student to risk enrollment at the University of Mississippi . \n",
      " The first song on the Freewheelin ' album , \" Blowin ' in the Wind \" , partly derived its melody from the traditional slave song , \" No More Auction Block \" , while its lyrics questioned the social and political status <unk> . The song was widely recorded by other artists and became a hit for Peter , Paul and Mary . Another Freewheelin ' song , \" A Hard Rain 's a @-@ Gonna Fall \" was based on the folk ballad \" Lord Randall \" . With veiled references to an impending <unk> , the song gained more resonance when the Cuban Missile Crisis developed a few weeks after Dylan began performing it . Like \" Blowin ' in the Wind \" , \" A Hard Rain 's a @-@ Gonna Fall \" marked a new direction in songwriting , blending a stream @-@ of @-@ consciousness , <unk> lyrical attack with traditional folk form . \n",
      " Dylan 's topical songs enhanced his early reputation , and he came to be seen as more than just a songwriter . Janet Maslin wrote of Freewheelin ' : \" These were the songs that established [ Dylan ] as the voice of his generation — someone who implicitly understood how concerned young Americans felt about nuclear <unk> and the growing movement for civil rights : his mixture of moral authority and <unk> was perhaps the most timely of his attributes . \" Freewheelin ' also included love songs and surreal talking blues . <unk> was an important part of Dylan 's persona , and the range of material on the album impressed listeners , including The Beatles . George Harrison said of the album , \" We just played it , just wore it out . The content of the song lyrics and just the attitude — it was incredibly original and wonderful . \" \n",
      " The rough edge of Dylan 's singing was unsettling to some but an attraction to others . Joyce Carol Oates wrote : \" When we first heard this raw , very young , and seemingly untrained voice , <unk> nasal , as if <unk> could sing , the effect was dramatic and <unk> . \" Many early songs reached the public through more palatable versions by other performers , such as Joan Baez , who became Dylan 's advocate as well as his lover . Baez was influential in bringing Dylan to prominence by recording several of his early songs and inviting him on stage during her concerts . \n",
      " Others who had hits with Dylan 's songs in the early 1960s included the Byrds , Sonny & <unk> , the <unk> , Peter , Paul and Mary , the Association , Manfred Mann and the Turtles . Most attempted a pop feel and rhythm , while Dylan and Baez performed them mostly as sparse folk songs . The covers became so ubiquitous that CBS promoted him with the slogan \" Nobody Sings Dylan Like Dylan . \" \n",
      " \" Mixed @-@ Up Confusion \" , recorded during the Freewheelin ' sessions with a backing band , was released as a single and then quickly withdrawn . In contrast to the mostly solo acoustic performances on the album , the single showed a willingness to experiment with a rockabilly sound . Cameron Crowe described it as \" a fascinating look at a folk artist with his mind wandering towards Elvis Presley and Sun Records . \" \n",

      " = = = = <unk> and Another Side = = = = \n",
      " \n",
      " In May 1963 , Dylan 's political profile rose when he walked out of The Ed Sullivan Show . During rehearsals , Dylan had been told by CBS television 's head of program practices that \" <unk> ' John Birch <unk> Blues \" was potentially <unk> to the John Birch Society . Rather than comply with censorship , Dylan refused to appear . \n",
      " By this time , Dylan and Baez were prominent in the civil rights movement , singing together at the March on Washington on August 28 , 1963 . Dylan 's third album , The Times They Are a @-@ <unk> ' , reflected a more <unk> and cynical Dylan . The songs often took as their subject matter contemporary stories , with \" Only A <unk> In Their Game \" addressing the murder of civil rights worker <unk> Evers ; and the <unk> \" The <unk> Death of <unk> Carroll \" the death of black hotel <unk> <unk> Carroll , at the hands of young white <unk> William <unk> . On a more general theme , \" Ballad of Hollis Brown \" and \" North Country Blues \" addressed despair engendered by the breakdown of farming and mining communities . This political material was accompanied by two personal love songs , \" Boots of Spanish <unk> \" and \" One Too Many <unk> \" . \n",
      " By the end of 1963 , Dylan felt both manipulated and constrained by the folk and protest movements . Accepting the \" Tom <unk> Award \" from the National Emergency Civil Liberties Committee shortly after the assassination of John F. Kennedy , an intoxicated Dylan questioned the role of the committee , characterized the members as old and <unk> , and claimed to see something of himself and of every man in Kennedy 's assassin , Lee Harvey Oswald . \n",
      " Another Side of Bob Dylan , recorded on a single evening in June 1964 , had a lighter mood . The humorous Dylan <unk> on \" I <unk> Be Free No. 10 \" and \" <unk> Nightmare \" . \" Spanish Harlem Incident \" and \" To <unk> \" are passionate love songs , while \" Black Crow Blues \" and \" I Don 't Believe You ( She Acts Like We Never Have Met ) \" suggest the rock and roll soon to dominate Dylan 's music . \" It Ain 't Me Babe \" , on the surface a song about <unk> love , has been described as a rejection of the role of political spokesman thrust upon him . His newest direction was signaled by two lengthy songs : the <unk> \" <unk> of Freedom \" , which sets social commentary against a metaphorical landscape in a style characterized by Allen Ginsberg as \" chains of flashing images , \" and \" My Back <unk> \" , which attacks the simplistic and arch seriousness of his own earlier topical songs and seems to predict the backlash he was about to encounter from his former champions as he took a new direction . \n",
      " In the latter half of 1964 and 1965 , Dylan moved from folk songwriter to folk @-@ rock pop @-@ music star . His <unk> and work shirts were replaced by a <unk> Street wardrobe , <unk> day or night , and pointed \" <unk> boots \" . A London reporter wrote : \" Hair that would set the teeth of a comb on edge . A loud shirt that would dim the neon lights of Leicester Square . He looks like an <unk> <unk> . \" Dylan began to spar with <unk> . Appearing on the Les Crane television show and asked about a movie he planned , he told Crane it would be a <unk> horror movie .

      " Dylan 's late March 1965 album Bringing It All Back Home was another leap , featuring his first recordings with electric instruments . The first single , \" <unk> <unk> Blues \" , owed much to Chuck Berry 's \" Too Much Monkey Business \" ; its free association lyrics described as <unk> back to the energy of beat poetry and as a forerunner of rap and hip @-@ hop . The song was provided with an early video , which opened D. A. Pennebaker 's <unk> <unk> presentation of Dylan 's 1965 tour of Great Britain , Dont Look Back . Instead of <unk> , Dylan illustrated the lyrics by throwing cue cards containing key words from the song on the ground . Pennebaker said the sequence was Dylan 's idea , and it has been imitated in music videos and advertisements . \n",
      " The second side of Bringing It All Back Home contained four long songs on which Dylan accompanied himself on acoustic guitar and harmonica . \" Mr. <unk> Man \" became one of his best known songs when The Byrds recorded an electric version that reached number one in the US and UK . \" It 's All Over Now , Baby Blue \" and \" It 's <unk> Ma ( I 'm Only Bleeding ) \" were two of Dylan 's most important compositions . \n",
      " In 1965 , heading the Newport Folk Festival , Dylan performed his first electric set since high school with a <unk> group mostly from the Paul <unk> Blues Band , featuring Mike <unk> ( guitar ) , Sam Lay ( drums ) and Jerome Arnold ( bass ) , plus Al Kooper ( organ ) and Barry Goldberg ( piano ) . Dylan had appeared at Newport in 1963 and 1964 , but in 1965 met with cheering and <unk> and left the stage after three songs . One version has it that the boos were from folk fans whom Dylan had alienated by appearing , unexpectedly , with an electric guitar . Murray Lerner , who filmed the performance , said : \" I absolutely think that they were <unk> Dylan going electric . \" An alternative account claims audience members were upset by poor sound and a short set . This account is supported by Kooper and one of the directors of the festival , who reports his recording proves the only boos were in reaction to the MC 's announcement that there was only enough time for a short set . \n",
      " Nevertheless , Dylan 's performance provoked a hostile response from the folk music establishment . In the September issue of Sing Out ! , Ewan <unk> wrote : \" Our traditional songs and ballads are the creations of extraordinarily talented artists working inside disciplines formulated over time ... ' But what of Bobby Dylan ? ' scream the outraged teenagers ... Only a completely non @-@ critical audience , nourished on the watery <unk> of pop music , could have fallen for such tenth @-@ rate <unk> . \" On July 29 , four days after Newport , Dylan was back in the studio in New York , recording \" <unk> 4th Street \" . The lyrics contained images of vengeance and paranoia , and it has been interpreted as Dylan 's put @-@ down of former friends from the folk community — friends he had known in clubs along West 4th Street . \n",

      " In July 1965 , the single \" Like a Rolling Stone \" peaked at two in the U.S. and at four in the UK charts . At over six minutes , the song altered what a pop single could convey . Bruce Springsteen , in his speech for Dylan 's inauguration into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , said that on first hearing the single , \" that <unk> shot sounded like somebody 'd kicked open the door to your mind \" . In 2004 and in 2011 , Rolling Stone listed it as number one of \" The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time \" . The song opened Dylan 's next album , Highway 61 Revisited , named after the road that led from Dylan 's Minnesota to the musical <unk> of New Orleans . The songs were in the same vein as the hit single , flavored by Mike <unk> 's blues guitar and Al Kooper 's organ riffs . \" <unk> Row \" , backed by acoustic guitar and understated bass , offers the sole exception , with Dylan alluding to figures in Western culture in a song described by Andy Gill as \" an 11 @-@ minute epic of entropy , which takes the form of a <unk> @-@ esque parade of <unk> and <unk> featuring a huge cast of celebrated characters , some historical ( Einstein , <unk> ) , some biblical ( <unk> , Cain and <unk> ) , some fictional ( Ophelia , Romeo , Cinderella ) , some literary ( T.S.

      " In support of the album , Dylan was booked for two U.S. concerts with Al Kooper and Harvey Brooks from his studio crew and Robbie Robertson and Levon Helm , former members of Ronnie Hawkins 's backing band the Hawks . On August 28 at Forest Hills Tennis Stadium , the group was heckled by an audience still annoyed by Dylan 's electric sound . The band 's reception on September 3 at the Hollywood Bowl was more favorable . \n",
      " From September 24 , 1965 , in Austin , Texas , Dylan toured the U.S. and Canada for six months , backed by the five musicians from the Hawks who became known as the Band . While Dylan and the Hawks met increasingly receptive audiences , their studio efforts <unk> . Producer Bob Johnston persuaded Dylan to record in Nashville in February 1966 , and surrounded him with top @-@ notch session men . At Dylan 's insistence , Robertson and Kooper came from New York City to play on the sessions . The Nashville sessions produced the double album Blonde on Blonde ( 1966 ) , featuring what Dylan called \" that thin wild mercury sound \" . Kooper described it as \" taking two cultures and <unk> them together with a huge explosion \" : the musical world of Nashville and the world of the \" quintessential New York <unk> \" Bob Dylan . \n",
      " On November 22 , 1965 , Dylan secretly married 25 @-@ year @-@ old former model Sara Lownds . Some of Dylan 's friends , including Ramblin ' Jack Elliott , say that , immediately after the event , Dylan denied he was married .

      " Dylan toured Australia and Europe in April and May 1966 . Each show was split in two . Dylan performed solo during the first half , accompanying himself on acoustic guitar and harmonica . In the second , backed by the Hawks , he played electrically amplified music . This contrast provoked many fans , who <unk> and slow <unk> . The tour culminated in a <unk> confrontation between Dylan and his audience at the Manchester Free Trade Hall in England on May 17 , 1966 . A recording of this concert was released in 1998 : The Bootleg Series Vol . 4 : Bob Dylan Live 1966 . At the climax of the evening , a member of the audience , angered by Dylan 's electric backing , shouted : \" Judas ! \" to which Dylan responded , \" I don 't believe you ... You 're a <unk> ! \" Dylan turned to his band and said , \" Play it fucking loud ! \" as they launched into the final song of the night — \" Like a Rolling Stone \" . \n",
      " During his 1966 tour , Dylan was described as exhausted and acting \" as if on a death trip \" . D. A. Pennebaker , the film maker accompanying the tour , described Dylan as \" taking a lot of <unk> and who @-@ knows @-@ what @-@ else . \" In a 1969 interview with <unk> <unk> , Dylan said , \" I was on the road for almost five years .

      " On July 29 , 1966 , Dylan crashed his <unk> Triumph Tiger 100 motorcycle near his home in Woodstock , New York and was thrown to the ground . Though the extent of his injuries was never disclosed , Dylan said that he broke several vertebrae in his neck . <unk> still surrounds the circumstances of the accident since no ambulance was called to the scene and Dylan was not hospitalized . Dylan 's biographers have written that the crash offered Dylan the chance to escape the pressures around him . Dylan confirmed this interpretation in his autobiography : \" I had been in a motorcycle accident and I 'd been hurt , but I recovered . Truth was that I wanted to get out of the rat race . \" Dylan withdrew from public and , apart from a few appearances , did not tour again for almost eight years . \n",
      " Once Dylan was well enough to resume creative work , he began to edit D. A. Pennebaker 's film of his 1966 tour . A rough cut was shown to ABC Television and rejected as incomprehensible to a mainstream audience . The film was subsequently titled Eat the <unk> on bootleg copies , and it has been screened at a handful of film festivals . In 1967 he began recording with the Hawks at his home and in the basement of the Hawks ' nearby house , \" Big Pink \" . These songs , initially demos for other artists to record , provided hits for Julie <unk> and the Brian <unk> Trinity ( \" This Wheel 's on Fire \" ) , The Byrds ( \" You Ain 't <unk> ' Nowhere \" , \" Nothing Was <unk> \" ) , and Manfred Mann ( \" Mighty Quinn \" ) . Columbia released selections in 1975 as The Basement Tapes . Over the years , more songs recorded by Dylan and his band in 1967 appeared on bootleg recordings , culminating in a five @-@ CD set titled The Genuine Basement Tapes , containing 107 songs and alternative takes . In the coming months , the Hawks recorded the album Music from Big Pink using songs they worked on in their basement in Woodstock , and renamed themselves the Band , beginning a long recording and performing career of their own . \n",
      " In October and November 1967 , Dylan returned to Nashville . Back in the studio after 19 months , he was accompanied by Charlie McCoy on bass , Kenny <unk> on drums , and Pete Drake on steel guitar . The result was John Wesley Harding , a contemplative record of shorter songs , set in a landscape that drew on the American West and the Bible . The sparse structure and instrumentation , with lyrics that took the <unk> @-@ Christian tradition seriously , departed from Dylan 's own work and from the psychedelic fervor of the 1960s . It included \" All Along the <unk> \" , with lyrics derived from the Book of Isaiah ( 21 : 5 – 9 ) . The song was later recorded by Jimi Hendrix , whose version Dylan acknowledged as definitive . Woody Guthrie died on October 3 , 1967 , and Dylan made his first live appearance in twenty months at a Guthrie memorial concert held at Carnegie Hall on January 20 , 1968 , where he was backed by the Band . \n",

Variety wrote , \" Dylan is definitely doing something that can be called singing .

Self Portrait , a double LP including few original songs , was poorly received . In October 1970 , Dylan released New Morning , considered a return to form .

On November 4 , 1971 , Dylan recorded \" George Jackson \" , which he released a week later .

The album included two versions of \" Forever Young \" , which became one of his most popular songs .

      " Columbia Records simultaneously released Dylan , a collection of studio outtakes ( almost exclusively covers ) , widely interpreted as a <unk> response to Dylan 's signing with a rival record label . In January 1974 , Dylan returned to touring after seven years ; backed by the Band , he embarked on a North American tour of 40 concerts . A live double album , Before the Flood , was on Asylum Records . Soon , according to Clive Davis , Columbia Records sent word they \" will spare nothing to bring Dylan back into the fold \" .

In <unk> , Bill Wyman wrote : \" Blood on the Tracks is his only flawless album and his best produced ; the songs , each of them , are constructed in disciplined fashion .

Despite its length — over eight minutes — the song was released as a single , peaking at 33 on the U.S. Billboard chart , and performed at every 1975 date of Dylan 's next tour , the Rolling Thunder Revue .

      " Dylan has been described as one of the most influential figures of the 20th century , musically and culturally . He was included in the Time 100 : The Most Important People of the Century where he was called \" master poet , <unk> social critic and intrepid , guiding spirit of the counterculture generation \" . In 2008 , The Pulitzer Prize jury awarded him a special citation for \" his profound impact on popular music and American culture , marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power . \" President Barack Obama said of Dylan in 2012 , \" There is not a bigger giant in the history of American music . \" In their 2008 assessment of the \" 100 Greatest Singers \" , Rolling Stone magazine ranked him at number seven . Rolling Stone then ranked Dylan at number two in its 2011 list of \" 100 Greatest Artists \" of all time , while \" Like A Rolling Stone \" was listed as the \" Greatest Song of all Time . \" In 2008 , it was estimated that Dylan had sold about 120 million albums worldwide . \n",
      " Initially modeling his writing style on the songs of Woody Guthrie , the blues of Robert Johnson , and what he termed the \" architectural forms \" of Hank Williams songs , Dylan added increasingly sophisticated lyrical techniques to the folk music of the early 1960s , <unk> it \" with the <unk> of classic literature and poetry \" . Paul Simon suggested that Dylan 's early compositions virtually took over the folk genre : \" [ Dylan 's ] early songs were very rich ... with strong melodies . ' Blowin ' in the Wind ' has a really strong melody . He so enlarged himself through the folk background that he incorporated it for a while . He defined the genre for a while . \" \n",
      " When Dylan made his move from acoustic folk and blues music to a rock backing , the mix became more complex . For many critics , his greatest achievement was the cultural synthesis exemplified by his mid @-@ 1960s trilogy of albums — Bringing It All Back Home , Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde . In Mike <unk> 's words : \n",
      " Between late 1964 and the middle of 1966 , Dylan created a body of work that remains unique . Drawing on folk , blues , country , R & B , rock 'n'roll , gospel , British beat , <unk> , modernist and Beat poetry , surrealism and <unk> , advertising <unk> and social commentary , <unk> and Mad magazine , he forged a coherent and original artistic voice and vision . The beauty of these albums retains the power to shock and console . \" \n",
      " Dylan 's lyrics began to receive detailed scrutiny from academics and poets . Literary critic Christopher Ricks published a 500 @-@ page analysis of Dylan 's work , placing him in the context of Eliot , Keats and Tennyson , claiming that Dylan was a poet worthy of the same close analysis . Former British poet laureate Sir Andrew Motion argued that his lyrics should be studied in schools . Since 1996 , academics have lobbied the Swedish Academy to award Dylan the Nobel Prize in Literature . \n",
      " Dylan 's voice also received critical attention . New York Times critic Robert Shelton described his early vocal style as \" a rusty voice suggesting Guthrie 's old performances , etched in gravel like Dave Van Ronk 's . \" David Bowie , in his tribute , \" Song for Bob Dylan \" , described Dylan 's singing as \" a voice like sand and glue \" . His voice continued to develop as he began to work with rock 'n'roll backing bands ; critic Michael Gray described the sound of Dylan 's vocal work on \" Like a Rolling Stone \" as \" at once young and <unk> cynical \" . As Dylan 's voice aged during the 1980s , for some critics , it became more expressive . Christophe <unk> writes in the journal Oral Tradition , \" Dylan 's more recent broken voice enables him to present a world view at the sonic surface of the songs — this voice carries us across the landscape of a broken , fallen world . The anatomy of a broken world in \" Everything is Broken \" ( on the album Oh Mercy ) is but an example of how the thematic concern with all things broken is grounded in a concrete sonic reality . \" \n",
      " Dylan is considered a seminal influence on several musical genres , especially folk rock , country rock and Christian rock . As Edna Gundersen stated in USA Today : \" Dylan 's musical DNA has informed nearly every simple twist of pop since 1962 . \" Punk musician Joe <unk> praised Dylan for having \" laid down the template for lyric , tune , seriousness , spirituality , depth of rock music . \" Other major musicians who acknowledged Dylan 's importance include Johnny Cash , Jerry Garcia , John Lennon , Paul McCartney , Pete <unk> , Neil Young , Bruce Springsteen , David Bowie , Bryan Ferry , Nick Cave , Patti Smith , Syd Barrett Joni Mitchell , and Tom <unk> . Dylan significantly contributed to the initial success of both the Byrds and the Band : the Byrds achieved chart success with their version of \" Mr. <unk> Man \" and the subsequent album , while the Band were Dylan 's backing band on his 1966 tour , recorded The Basement Tapes with him in 1967 , and featured three previously unreleased Dylan songs on their debut album . \n",
      " Some critics have <unk> from the view of Dylan as a visionary figure in popular music . In his book <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> objected : \" I can 't take the vision of Dylan as seer , as teenage <unk> , as everything else he 's been worshipped as . The way I see him , he 's a minor talent with a major gift for self @-@ hype . \" Australian critic Jack <unk> credited Dylan with changing the persona of the rock star : \" What cannot be disputed is that Dylan invented the arrogant , faux @-@ <unk> posturing that has been the dominant style in rock since , with everyone from Mick Jagger to Eminem <unk> themselves from the Dylan <unk> . \" \n",
      " Fellow musicians also presented dissenting views . Joni Mitchell described Dylan as a \" <unk> \" and his voice as \" fake \" in a 2010 interview in the Los Angeles Times , in response to a suggestion that she and Dylan were similar since they had both created personas . Mitchell 's comment led to discussions of Dylan 's use of other people 's material , both supporting and criticizing him . In 2013 Mitchell told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation ( <unk> ) in an interview that her remarks in the Los Angeles Times had been taken \" completely out of context \" , and that the interviewer was a \" <unk> \" . Mitchell added : \" I like a lot of Bob 's songs . Musically he 's not very gifted . He 's borrowed his voice from old <unk> . He 's got a lot of borrowed things . He 's not a great guitar player . He 's invented a character to deliver his songs . \" \n",
      " Talking to <unk> Gilmore in Rolling Stone in 2012 , Dylan responded to the allegation of plagiarism , including his use of Henry <unk> 's verse in his album Modern Times , by saying that it was \" part of the tradition \" . \n",
      " If Dylan 's work in the 1960s was seen as bringing intellectual ambition to popular music , critics in the 21st century described him as a figure who had greatly expanded the folk culture from which he initially emerged . Following the release of Todd Haynes ' Dylan <unk> I 'm Not There , J. <unk> wrote in his 2007 Village Voice review : \n",
      " Elvis might never have been born , but someone else would surely have brought the world rock ' n ' roll . No such logic accounts for Bob Dylan . No iron law of history demanded that a would @-@ be Elvis from Hibbing , Minnesota , would <unk> through the Greenwich Village folk revival to become the world 's first and greatest rock ' n ' roll <unk> bard and then — having achieved fame and adoration beyond reckoning — vanish into a folk tradition of his own making . \n",
      " Prior to the June 2014 sale of the original lyrics of \" Like a Rolling Stone \" , written on four sheets of hotel <unk> by Dylan in 1965 , Richard Austin , of <unk> 's , New York , said : \" Before the release of Like a Rolling Stone , music charts were overrun with short and sweet love songs , many <unk> in at three minutes or less . By <unk> convention with six and a half minutes of dark , brooding poetry , Dylan rewrote the rules for pop music . \" \n",

      " The common starling ( Sturnus vulgaris ) , also known as the European starling , or in the British Isles just the starling , is a medium @-@ sized <unk> bird in the starling family , Sturnidae . It is about 20 cm ( 8 in ) long and has glossy black plumage with a metallic <unk> , which is speckled with white at some times of year . The legs are pink and the bill is black in winter and yellow in summer ; young birds have <unk> plumage than the adults . It is a noisy bird , especially in communal roosts and other gregarious situations , with an <unk> but varied song . Its gift for mimicry has been noted in literature including the <unk> and the works of Pliny the Elder and William Shakespeare . \n",
      " The common starling has about a dozen subspecies breeding in open habitats across its native range in temperate Europe and western Asia , and it has been introduced to Australia , New Zealand , Canada , United States , Mexico , Peru , Argentina , the Falkland Islands , Brazil , Chile , Uruguay , South Africa and Fiji . This bird is resident in southern and western Europe and southwestern Asia , while northeastern populations migrate south and west in winter within the breeding range and also further south to Iberia and North Africa . The common starling builds an untidy nest in a natural or artificial cavity in which four or five glossy , pale blue eggs are laid . These take two weeks to hatch and the young remain in the nest for another three weeks . There are normally one or two breeding attempts each year . This species is omnivorous , taking a wide range of invertebrates , as well as seeds and fruit . It is hunted by various mammals and birds of prey , and is host to a range of external and internal parasites . \n",
      " Large flocks typical of this species can be beneficial to agriculture by controlling invertebrate pests ; however , starlings can also be pests themselves when they feed on fruit and sprouting crops . Common starlings may also be a nuisance through the noise and mess caused by their large urban roosts . Introduced populations in particular have been subjected to a range of controls , including culling , but these have had limited success except in preventing the colonisation of Western Australia . The species has declined in numbers in parts of northern and western Europe since the 1980s due to fewer grassland invertebrates being available as food for growing chicks . Despite this , its huge global population is not thought to be declining significantly , so the common starling is classified as being of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature . \n",

      " The common starling was first described by Linnaeus in his Systema <unk> in 1758 under its current binomial name . Sturnus and vulgaris are derived from the Latin for \" starling \" and \" common \" respectively . The Old English <unk> , later stare , and the Latin <unk> are both derived from an unknown Indo @-@ European root dating back to the second millennium BC . \" <unk> \" was first recorded in the 11th century , when it referred to the juvenile of the species , but by the 16th century it had already largely <unk> \" stare \" to refer to birds of all ages . The older name is referenced in William Butler Yeats ' poem \" The <unk> 's Nest by My Window \" . The International <unk> Congress ' preferred English vernacular name is common starling . \n",
      " The starling family , Sturnidae , is an entirely Old World group apart from introductions elsewhere , with the greatest numbers of species in Southeast Asia and sub @-@ Saharan Africa . The genus Sturnus is <unk> and relationships between its members are not fully resolved . The closest relation of the common starling is the spotless starling . The non @-@ migratory spotless starling may be descended from a population of ancestral S. vulgaris that survived in an Iberian <unk> during an ice age retreat , and mitochondrial gene studies suggest that it could be considered as a subspecies of the common starling . There is more genetic variation between common starling populations than between nominate common starling and spotless starling . Although common starling remains are known from the Middle Pleistocene , part of the problem in resolving relationships in the Sturnidae is the <unk> of the fossil record for the family as a whole . \n",

      " The common starling is 19 – 23 cm ( 7 @.@ 5 – 9 @.@ 1 in ) long , with a wingspan of 31 – 44 cm ( 12 – 17 in ) and a weight of 58 – 101 g ( 2 @.@ 0 – 3 @.@ 6 oz ) .

The plumage is <unk> black , <unk> purple or green , and spangled with white , especially in winter . The underparts of adult male common starlings are less spotted than those of adult females at a given time of year . The throat feathers of males are long and loose and are used in display while those of females are smaller and more pointed . The legs are stout and <unk> or greyish @-@ red . The bill is narrow and conical with a sharp tip ; in the winter it is brownish @-@ black but in summer , females have lemon yellow beaks while males have yellow bills with blue @-@ grey bases . <unk> occurs once a <unk> in late summer after the breeding season has finished ; the fresh feathers are prominently tipped white ( breast feathers ) or buff ( wing and back feathers ) , which gives the bird a speckled appearance . The reduction in the spotting in the breeding season is achieved through the white feather tips largely wearing off . Juveniles are grey @-@ brown and by their first winter resemble adults though often retaining some brown juvenile <unk> , especially on the head . They can usually be <unk> by the colour of the irises , rich brown in males , mouse @-@ brown or grey in females . <unk> the contrast between an iris and the central always @-@ dark pupil is 97 % accurate in determining sex , rising to 98 % if the length of the throat feathers is also considered . The common starling is mid @-@ sized by both starling standards and <unk> standards . It is readily distinguished from other mid @-@ sized <unk> , such as <unk> , <unk> or small <unk> , by its relatively short tail , sharp , blade @-@ like bill , round @-@ bellied shape and strong , sizeable ( and rufous @-@ coloured ) legs . In flight , its strongly pointed wings and dark colouration are distinctive , while on the ground its strange , somewhat <unk> gait is also characteristic . The colouring and build usually distinguish this bird from other starlings , although the closely related spotless starling may be physically distinguished by the lack of <unk> spots in adult breeding plumage . \n",
      " Like most terrestrial starlings the common starling moves by walking or running , rather than hopping . Their flight is quite strong and direct ; their triangular @-@ shaped wings beat very rapidly , and periodically the birds <unk> for a short way without losing much height before resuming powered flight . When in a flock , the birds take off almost simultaneously , wheel and turn in <unk> , form a compact mass or trail off into a <unk> stream , bunch up again and land in a coordinated fashion . Common starling on migration can fly at 60 – 80 km / h ( 37 – 50 mph ) and cover up to 1 @,@ 000 – 1 @,@ 500 km ( 620 – 930 mi ) . \n",
      " Several terrestrial starlings , including those in the genus Sturnus , have adaptations of the skull and muscles that help with feeding by probing . This adaptation is most strongly developed in the common starling ( along with the spotless and white @-@ <unk> starlings ) , where the <unk> muscles responsible for opening the jaw are enlarged and the skull is narrow , allowing the eye to be moved forward to peer down the length of the bill . This technique involves inserting the bill into the ground and opening it as a way of searching for hidden food items . Common starlings have the physical traits that enable them to use this feeding technique , which has undoubtedly helped the species spread far and wide . \n",
      " In Iberia , the western Mediterranean and northwest Africa , the common starling may be confused with the closely related spotless starling , the plumage of which , as its name implies , has a more uniform colour . At close range it can be seen that the latter has longer throat feathers , a fact particularly noticeable when it sings . \n",

      " The common starling is a noisy bird . Its song consists of a wide variety of both melodic and mechanical @-@ sounding noises as part of a ritual succession of sounds . The male is the main <unk> and engages in bouts of song lasting for a minute or more . Each of these typically includes four varieties of song type , which follow each other in a regular order without pause . The bout starts with a series of pure @-@ tone whistles and these are followed by the main part of the song , a number of variable sequences that often incorporate <unk> of song mimicked from other species of bird and various naturally occurring or man @-@ made noises . The structure and simplicity of the sound mimicked is of greater importance than the frequency with which it occurs . Each sound clip is repeated several times before the bird moves on to the next . After this variable section comes a number of types of repeated <unk> followed by a final burst of high @-@ frequency song , again formed of several types . Each bird has its own repertoire with more proficient birds having a range of up to 35 variable song types and as many as 14 types of <unk> . \n",
      " Males sing constantly as the breeding period approaches and perform less often once pairs have bonded . In the presence of a female , a male sometimes flies to his nest and sings from the entrance , apparently attempting to entice the female in . Older birds tend to have a wider repertoire than younger ones . Those males that engage in longer bouts of singing and that have wider <unk> attract mates earlier and have greater reproductive success than others . Females appear to prefer mates with more complex songs , perhaps because this indicates greater experience or longevity . Having a complex song is also useful in defending a territory and <unk> less experienced males from encroaching . \n",
      " Singing also occurs outside the breeding season , taking place throughout the year apart from the <unk> period . The <unk> are more commonly male although females also sing on occasion . The function of such out @-@ of @-@ season song is poorly understood . Eleven other types of call have been described including a flock call , threat call , attack call , <unk> call and copulation call . The alarm call is a harsh scream , and while foraging together common starlings <unk> incessantly . They <unk> while roosting and bathing , making a great deal of noise that can cause irritation to people living nearby . When a flock of common starlings is flying together , the <unk> movements of the birds ' wings make a distinctive <unk> sound that can be heard hundreds of metres ( yards ) away . \n",

Measures are being introduced to reduce common starling populations by culling before the <unk> return to their breeding colonies in spring . \n",
      " There are several methods by which common starlings obtain their food but for the most part , they forage close to the ground , taking insects from the surface or just underneath . Generally , common starlings prefer foraging amongst short @-@ cropped grasses and are often found among grazing animals or perched on their backs , where they will also feed on the mammal 's external parasites . Large flocks may engage in a practice known as \" roller @-@ feeding \" , where the birds at the back of the flock continually fly to the front where the feeding opportunities are best . The larger the flock , the nearer individuals are to one another while foraging . Flocks often feed in one place for some time , and return to previous successfully <unk> sites . \n",
      " There are three types of foraging behaviour observed in the common starling . \" <unk> \" involves the bird <unk> its beak into the ground randomly and <unk> until an insect has been found , and is often accompanied by bill <unk> where the bird opens its beak in the soil to <unk> a hole . This behaviour , first described by Konrad Lorenz and given the German term <unk> , is also used to create and widen holes in plastic garbage bags . It takes time for young common starlings to perfect this technique , and because of this the diet of young birds will often contain fewer insects . \" <unk> \" is the capture of flying insects directly from the air , and \" <unk> \" is the less common technique of striking forward to catch a moving invertebrate on the ground . <unk> are caught by pulling from soil . Common starlings that have periods without access to food , or have a reduction in the hours of light available for feeding , compensate by increasing their body mass by the deposition of fat . \n",

      " <unk> males find a suitable cavity and begin to build nests in order to attract single females , often <unk> the nest with ornaments such as flowers and fresh green material , which the female later <unk> upon accepting him as a mate . The amount of green material is not important , as long as some is present , but the presence of herbs in the decorative material appears to be significant in attracting a mate . The scent of plants such as <unk> acts as an olfactory <unk> to females . \n",
      " The males sing throughout much of the construction and even more so when a female approaches his nest . Following copulation , the male and female continue to build the nest .

S. v. zetlandicus typically breeds in crevices and holes in cliffs , a habitat only rarely used by the nominate form . Nests are typically made out of straw , dry grass and twigs with an inner lining made up of feathers , wool and soft leaves . Construction usually takes four or five days and may continue through incubation . \n",
      " Common starlings are both monogamous and <unk> ; although broods are generally brought up by one male and one female , occasionally the pair may have an extra <unk> . <unk> may be part of a colony , in which case several other nests may occupy the same or nearby trees .

      " Breeding takes place during the spring and summer . Following copulation , the female lays eggs on a daily basis over a period of several days . If an egg is lost during this time , she will lay another to replace it . There are normally four or five eggs that are <unk> in shape and pale blue or occasionally white , and they commonly have a glossy appearance . The colour of the eggs seems to have evolved through the relatively good visibility of blue at low light levels . The egg size is 26 @.@ 5 – 34 @.@ 5 mm ( 1 @.@ 04 – 1 @.@ 36 in ) in length and 20 @.@ 0 – 22 @.@ 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 – 0 @.@ 89 in ) in maximum diameter . \n",
      " Incubation lasts thirteen days , although the last egg laid may take 24 hours longer than the first to hatch .

The young are born blind and naked . They develop light fluffy down within seven days of hatching and can see within nine days . Once the chicks are able to regulate their body temperature , about six days after hatching , the adults largely cease removing droppings from the nest . Prior to that , the <unk> would wet both the chicks ' plumage and the nest material , thereby reducing their effectiveness as <unk> and increasing the risk of chilling the <unk> . <unk> remain in the nest for three weeks , where they are fed continuously by both parents . Fledglings continue to be fed by their parents for another one or two weeks . A pair can raise up to three broods per year , frequently reusing and <unk> the same nest , although two broods is typical , or just one north of <unk> .
